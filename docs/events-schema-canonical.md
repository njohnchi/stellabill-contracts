# Canonical Event Schema Reference

This document defines all stable event schemas emitted by the subscription vault contract. Events are indexed and emitted exactly once per successful state transition or fund movement.

## Event Emission Strategy

All events follow this pattern:

```rust
env.events().publish(
    (Symbol::new(env, "event_name"), subscription_id_or_resource_id),
    EventStructWithAllFields {
        ...
    },
);
```

**Key Principles:**
- Topic tuple format: `(Symbol, optional_id)` — enables filtering by event type and resource
- Data struct: always a named type (never raw tuples) — provides stable schema for indexers
- Timestamp: included when useful for ordering/metrics
- No sensitive data: all event fields are customer-visible
- One per action: ensures deterministic batch operation ordering

## Security Considerations

### No Sensitive Data in Events

Events are **public blockchain data**. The following are **intentionally NOT included**:

- ✗ Private keys or account secrets
- ✗ Optional metadata values (only keys are emitted)
- ✗ Subscriber email or PII (only Address)
- ✗ Merchant fee percentages or routing details (only transactions recorded)
- ✗ Grace period configuration (only status transition events)

### Failure Events Are Explicit

Subscriptions that fail charging emit `SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent` — never emit a "success" event. This ensures indexers can distinguish:

- ✓ Successful charge → `SubscriptionChargedEvent`
- ✗ Failed charge → `SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent`
- ✗ Charge not attempted (wrong status) → no event

### Deterministic Batch Ordering

`batch_charge()` emits exactly one event per successfully charged subscription, in the order subscriptions were processed. Failed charges do not emit events. This ensures indexers can reconstruct execution order without re-querying the contract.

### Authorization Events Include Authorizer

When an action requires explicit authorization (`pause`, `resume`, `cancel`, `refund`), the `authorizer` field in the event identifies who approved it:

- Subscriber initiated
- Merchant initiated
- Admin initiated (for recovery)

This enables audit trails for compliance.

## Indexing Recommendations

| Event | Index By | Aggregate By |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| SubscriptionCreatedEvent | subscription_id, subscriber, merchant | time (metrics) |
| FundsDepositedEvent | subscription_id, subscriber | balance progression |
| SubscriptionChargedEvent | subscription_id, merchant, token | merchant earnings, pvt revenue |
| SubscriptionChargeFailedEvent | subscription_id, subscriber | recovery metrics |
| MerchantWithdrawalEvent | merchant, token, timestamp | payout history |
| LifetimeCapReachedEvent | subscription_id, merchant, timestamp | completion metrics |
| SubscriptionCancelledEvent | subscription_id, subscriber, timestamp | churn metrics |
| MerchantPausedEvent | merchant, timestamp | merchant downtime |

---

## Timestamp Precision

All timestamps are **ledger timestamps in seconds** (Unix epoch). Resolution is not nanosecond-accurate; use for relative ordering and metrics, not high-frequency reconciliation.
